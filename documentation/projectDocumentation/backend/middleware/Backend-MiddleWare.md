This folder contains all functions for our middleware.

Add new functions:
------------------

To add new functions you have two options:

1.  A file related to your functions exists
    
2.  No file related to your function exists
    

In the first case you can simply extend the file with your function. In the second case you have to create a new file. The naming convention is “{name}MiddleWare.ts”.
